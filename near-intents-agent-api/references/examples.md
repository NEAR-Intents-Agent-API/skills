# Runnable examples

Repository: <https://github.com/NEAR-Intents-Agent-API/examples> (TypeScript, Node 24+, pnpm,
`@near-intents-agent-api/sdk`, `near-api-js`, `viem`). Every flow in this skill has a script there;
port the script when writing another language.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NEAR-Intents-Agent-API/examples && cd examples
cp .env.example .env        # AGENT_API_KEY from the partner dashboard; owner keys for writes
pnpm install
pnpm 01:check-api
```

Safety switches: writes refuse to run unless `AGENT_ALLOW_WRITES=true`; swaps, withdrawals and
other live actions stay in preview unless `AGENT_EXECUTE=true`. The hosted API is mainnet: use a
dedicated low-value owner account.

Useful support modules to copy: `support/sign-near-intent.ts` (server-side NEAR signer:
NEP-413 + NEP-366), `support/evm-owner.ts` (EVM owner descriptor + EIP-712),
`support/policy.ts` (policy builders), `support/destinations.ts`, `support/flow.ts`
(generate → sign → submit → wait), `support/raw-http.ts` (fetch client with JSON:API errors).

Python and Rust equivalents of the client and signers ship with this skill in `assets/`.
