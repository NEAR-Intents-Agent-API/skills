# Status, idempotency and recovery

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Your move |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING_SIGNATURE` | owner intent generated, not yet signed | get the signature or let it expire |
| `QUEUED` | held by the policy timelock until `details.execute_after` | wait; owner may `execution_cancel` |
| `PENDING_APPROVAL` | waiting for the owner's `approval_vote` (`details.approval_id`) | ask the owner; poll slowly |
| `PENDING_DEPOSIT` | deposit address issued, waiting for funds | show `deposit_address`; poll until `expires_at` |
| `PROCESSING` | submitted, settlement not yet observed | keep polling |
| `SUCCESS` | settled with evidence | done |
| `REFUNDED` | route refunded the input (`refund_tx_hash`) | done; tell the user |
| `FAILED` | never executed, or failed with `failure_code` | done; new request needs a new key |
| `UNCERTAIN` | outcome unknown, **may have executed** | keep polling the same id; never resubmit under a new key |
| `NEEDS_REVIEW` | automatic settlement stopped | stop; inspect `details.reason`; then `refresh=true` |

Terminal: `SUCCESS`, `REFUNDED`, `FAILED`. `UNCERTAIN` usually resolves on its own as the API
reconciles with the provider.

## Polling

```text
GET /v1/status?correlation_id=<id>&wait_ms=30000
```

- Long-poll: returns early when the status becomes terminal, needs a signature, or needs review;
  otherwise after `wait_ms` (max 30000). Reading also advances the operation (the API checks
  chain/provider on read), so polling is how slow operations make progress — don't stop early.
- Max 10 concurrent long-polls per API key; further reads answer immediately (no error), so
  don't build a tight loop on top of them. Add a small sleep when a read returns instantly with
  a non-terminal status.
- Typical loop: repeat while status ∈ {`PROCESSING`, `QUEUED`} up to your deadline (a few
  minutes for swaps/transfers, longer for cross-chain withdrawals and deposits). For
  `PENDING_APPROVAL` / `PENDING_DEPOSIT` hand control back to the user and poll on a slower
  schedule (or when they return).
- `GET /v1/agents/{id}/history` lists everything for an activity feed (newest first).
- A single long poll does not promise settlement; `SUCCESS` means reconciled evidence, not just
  a broadcast hash.

```python
def settle(api, cid, deadline_s=300):
    end = time.monotonic() + deadline_s
    while True:
        s = api.get_status(cid, wait_ms=30_000)
        if s["status"] not in ("PROCESSING", "QUEUED") or time.monotonic() > end:
            return s
```

## Idempotency keys

- Required on every non-dry execution and deposit; optional on `generate-intent`.
- 8–128 characters from `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`. A UUIDv4 or `"<action>:<your_request_id>"` works.
  Don't build keys from unbounded user data (length) or from values that repeat across distinct
  requests (e.g. `transfer-${agentId}-${recipient}` would block the second payment to the same
  person).
- **Create → persist with the body → send.** If the process dies after sending, the stored key
  lets you find or safely repeat the request.
- Same key + same body → the original operation (no double spend), even across restarts.
- Same key + different body → `409 idempotency_conflict`.
- After a definitive refusal or `FAILED`, a retry is a new request → new key.
- SDK/assets return the key they used (`result.idempotencyKey`, `AgentApiRequestError.idempotencyKey`)
  so you can retry with it after a transport error.

## UNCERTAIN

The API lost the provider's answer around dispatch, so it cannot prove whether the money moved.

1. Keep polling the same `correlation_id`. The API reconciles via the provider's records.
2. Never resubmit under a new idempotency key — that can pay twice.
3. If it stays `UNCERTAIN`, look at the operation:
   - has `provider_request_id` or `dispatch_committed_at` → **the provider got it**. Only
     polling resolves it. Never recover.
   - neither → **the provider never got it**. `POST …/recover` may dispatch it, once.

### `POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/recover`

```http
POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/recover
X-API-Key: <the key that admitted the operation>
X-Grant-Token: <the token of the grant that admitted it>
Idempotency-Key: <the ORIGINAL key>
{ "correlation_id": "op_…", "request": { "type": "withdraw", …the original body, byte-identical after canonicalization… } }
```

Authorization runs again in full: if the grant was revoked, the account frozen or the policy
tightened since, recovery is refused. `operation_not_recoverable` means it was not eligible (not
UNCERTAIN, already reached the provider, cross-chain deposit, or another API key);
`operation_recovery_unavailable` means a recovery is already running. This is why you persist
the original body and key.

## NEEDS_REVIEW

Automatic settlement stopped because something did not add up (e.g. evidence conflicts).

1. Stop polling and stop retrying.
2. Read `details.reason`; cross-check `GET …/provider/requests`, `…/provider/audit`,
   balances.
3. After resolving, `GET /v1/status?correlation_id=…&refresh=true` to re-observe.
4. Surface it to an operator; don't tell the user the payment failed or succeeded.

## Operation proofs

`GET /v1/agents/{agent_id}/operations/{correlation_id}/proof` (an `op_…` id) returns every
retained audit event of one execution, each `PROVEN` with a `c2sp.org/tlog-proof@v1` against the
notary-signed checkpoint of the API's transparency log, `PENDING` until the next checkpoint covers
it, or `UNLOGGED`. Use it to audit an execution offline without trusting the API; it does not
change the execution's status.

## Revocation and freezing vs in-flight work

`dispatch_committed_at` is the point of no return. Before it, revoking the grant, revoking the
API key or freezing refuses the operation. After it, the operation completes; `grant_revoke`
details and API-key revocation list those committed ids.
